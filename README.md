# GitHub Webhook â†’ Cursor Dev Automation Server

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

- Receives GitHub webhook events
- Detects when issues/cards move to `In Progress`
- Detects when pull requests are merged
- Logs structured messages (`TRIGGER_CLAUDE`) so Claude or GPT inside Cursor can act automatically using GitHub MCP tools

## ðŸš€ How to Deploy (Railway)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Create a new Railway project from the GitHub repo
3. Add environment variable: `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
4. Set GitHub webhook (Settings > Webhooks) with:

   - Content-Type: `application/json`
   - Secret: same as `.env`
